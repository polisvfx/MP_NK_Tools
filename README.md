# CornerPinRef

  Adds a new Tab and two buttons, one that removes all animation from the "From" tab and one that copies the current "From" values to the "To" values.
  This is helpful in setting reference frames for copy/pasted Mocha tracking data or similar data.


# ShotSetup

  A gizmo that either auto-defines the framerange or lets you determine a custom range. The defined range will be set to start at frame 1001. If your footage has handles, you can define the amount of handles and the clip will start at 1001-Handles (1001 minus the number of handles, 989 for 12f handles).
  You can also add or substract handles, if you plate has 50 handles but you only need 12, you would define the handles as 50 and enter -38 in the Add Handles field.
